## Chapter 1: Selecting you target market

### Why targeting everyone with your product or service is a terrible idea
Trying to target everyone really means that you’re targeting no one. By going too broad you kill your "specialness"
and become a commodity bought on price.

### Why mass marketing can be harmful to your business and cost you far more than it makes you
For mass marketing or branding to work, it is too expensive for small businesses. You need to broadcast your message
regularly for a long period of time via multiple media channels so that people remember and recognize you.

### How to use the “PVP index” to select your perfect target market
A great way of figuring out your ideal target market is to use the PVP index by giving each market segment you serve a
rating out of 10.
- P - Personal Fulfilment
- V - Value to the marketplace
- P - Profitability

### Why you should focus on a niche and become a big fish in a small pond
- You have limited amount of money, if you focus too broadly, your marketing message will become weak and diluted.
- The other critical factor is relevance. The gold of your ad is for your prospect to say, "Hey that's for me!"

### How to make price irrelevant
By being a specialist, you are perceived differently by your prospects and customers. A specialist is sought after
rather than shopped on price. A specialist is much more highly respected than a jack-of-all-trades. A specialist is paid
handsomely to solve a specific problem for their target market.

### Why you should stop advertising a long list of products and services
If the ad just rolls out a broad laundry list of products or services, then it’s not speaking to any prospects,
therefore it’s not relevant, and it will likely be ignored by all market segments.
 
### How to go deep into the mind of your prospect so you can understand exactly what they want
One of the best tools for getting into the mind of your prospects is to temporarily become them by creating an avatar.
An avatar is a detailed exploration and description of your target customer and their life.
It's also important to create avatars for each type of decision maker or influencer you might encounter in your target
market.

## Chapter 2: Crafting your message

### Why most advertising is totally useless and what to do instead
Most advertising by small businesses is inwardly focused. Instead of speaking to the needs and problems of the prospect,
it is focused on self-aggrandizement. The prominent logo and company name, the laundry list of services, the claims of
being the leading provider of that product or service.

By contrast, direct response marketing focuses heavily on the needs, thoughts, and emotions of the target market.
By doing this, you enter the conversation already going on in the mind of your ideal prospect. You will resonate at a
deeper level with your prospect, and your ad will stand out from 99% of other ads that are just shouting and talking
about themselves.

### How to stand out from the crowd even when you’re selling a commodity
By developing unique selling proposition. Something that positions you differently, so that prospects are forced to
make an apples-to-oranges comparison when comparing you with your competitor.

If they can do an apples-to-apples comparison of you and your competitors, then it comes down to price, and you’re toast.
There’s always someone willing to sell cheaper than you.

So the two questions you must ask yourself and answer are:
- Why should they buy?
- Why should they buy from me?

What is the unique advantage you are offering? Now, the uniqueness does not have to be in the product itself.
In fact, it’s fair to say that there are very few truly unique products. The uniqueness may be in the way
it is packaged, delivered, supported or even sold.
 
### Why you should never compete solely on price
A USP that promises the lowest prices on some things, some of the time is not quite so compelling.
The fact is, if you’re a small or medium business, you’re unlikely to beat the big discounters at the lowest price game.

### How to craft a compelling offer for your target market
#### Questions to ask yourself
- Of all the products and services you offer, which do you have the most confidence in delivering?
- Of all the products and services you offer, which do you enjoy delivering the most?
- What is my target market really buying? For example, people don’t really buy insurance; they buy peace of mind.
- What’s the biggest benefit to lead with?
- What are the best emotionally charged words and phrases that will capture and hold the attention of this market?
- What objections do my prospects have and how will I solve them?
- What outrageous offer (including a guarantee) can I make? 
- Is there an intriguing story I can tell?
- Who else is selling something similar to my product or service, and how?
- Who else has tried selling this target market something similar, and how has that effort failed? 
 
#### What does my target market want?
By analyzing what your target market is actually buying or looking for
- Look at products and categories that are trending on marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.
- Analyzing search engine queries using a tool like Google’s AdWords Keyword Planner can be another excellent method.
- See what topics are trending on social media and industry news sites. What are people commenting on and reacting to?

#### Offers
- Language - You need to learn the language and jargon used within your target market.
- Reason why - When you have a great offer, you need to justify why you are doing this.
- Value stacking - Packing in many bonuses can make your offer seems like a no-brainer.
- Upsells
- Payment plan
- Guarantee
- Scarcity
- Target the pain
- Don't use monotone professional sales copy. open. People love to be entertained. Being yourself and bringing out
your personality will help you stand out in a sea of sameness and monotony.
- People buy from people, not from corporations.

### How to enter the mind of your prospect and join the conversation going on in there
- Before you ever write a single word of copy, you must intimately understand
  - how your target market thinks and talks,
  - the kind of language they use and respond to
  - what kind of day they have and the conversation that goes on in their minds.
  - their fears and frustrations
  - what gets them excited and motivated
- Tell potential prospects who your product or service is NOT for.
- Find out what they blame, and use a device in your copy known as "the enemy in common".

### How to effectively name your business, product, or service
If the name does not make it automatically obvious what the product, service or business is, then you’re starting
from behind.
