## Chapter 1: Selecting you target market

### Why targeting everyone with your product or service is a terrible idea
Trying to target everyone really means that you're targeting no one. By going too broad you kill your "specialness"
and become a commodity bought on price.

### Why mass marketing can be harmful to your business and cost you far more than it makes you
For mass marketing or branding to work, it is too expensive for small businesses. You need to broadcast your message
regularly for a long period of time via multiple media channels so that people remember and recognize you.

### How to use the "PVP index" to select your perfect target market
A great way of figuring out your ideal target market is to use the PVP index by giving each market segment you serve a
rating out of 10.
- P - Personal Fulfilment
- V - Value to the marketplace
- P - Profitability

### Why you should focus on a niche and become a big fish in a small pond
- You have limited amount of money, if you focus too broadly, your marketing message will become weak and diluted.
- The other critical factor is relevance. The gold of your ad is for your prospect to say, "Hey that's for me!"

### How to make price irrelevant
By being a specialist, you are perceived differently by your prospects and customers. A specialist is sought after
rather than shopped on price. A specialist is much more highly respected than a jack-of-all-trades. A specialist is paid
handsomely to solve a specific problem for their target market.

### Why you should stop advertising a long list of products and services
If the ad just rolls out a broad laundry list of products or services, then it's not speaking to any prospects,
therefore it's not relevant, and it will likely be ignored by all market segments.
 
### How to go deep into the mind of your prospect so you can understand exactly what they want
One of the best tools for getting into the mind of your prospects is to temporarily become them by creating an avatar.
An avatar is a detailed exploration and description of your target customer and their life.
It's also important to create avatars for each type of decision maker or influencer you might encounter in your target
market.

## Chapter 2: Crafting your message

### Why most advertising is totally useless and what to do instead
Most advertising by small businesses is inwardly focused. Instead of speaking to the needs and problems of the prospect,
it is focused on self-aggrandizement. The prominent logo and company name, the laundry list of services, the claims of
being the leading provider of that product or service.

By contrast, direct response marketing focuses heavily on the needs, thoughts, and emotions of the target market.
By doing this, you enter the conversation already going on in the mind of your ideal prospect. You will resonate at a
deeper level with your prospect, and your ad will stand out from 99% of other ads that are just shouting and talking
about themselves.

### How to stand out from the crowd even when you're selling a commodity
By developing unique selling proposition. Something that positions you differently, so that prospects are forced to
make an apples-to-oranges comparison when comparing you with your competitor.

If they can do an apples-to-apples comparison of you and your competitors, then it comes down to price, and you're toast.
There's always someone willing to sell cheaper than you.

So the two questions you must ask yourself and answer are:
- Why should they buy?
- Why should they buy from me?

What is the unique advantage you are offering? Now, the uniqueness does not have to be in the product itself.
In fact, it's fair to say that there are very few truly unique products. The uniqueness may be in the way
it is packaged, delivered, supported or even sold.
 
### Why you should never compete solely on price
A USP that promises the lowest prices on some things, some of the time is not quite so compelling.
The fact is, if you're a small or medium business, you're unlikely to beat the big discounters at the lowest price game.

### How to craft a compelling offer for your target market
#### Questions to ask yourself
- Of all the products and services you offer, which do you have the most confidence in delivering?
- Of all the products and services you offer, which do you enjoy delivering the most?
- What is my target market really buying? For example, people don't really buy insurance; they buy peace of mind.
- What's the biggest benefit to lead with?
- What are the best emotionally charged words and phrases that will capture and hold the attention of this market?
- What objections do my prospects have and how will I solve them?
- What outrageous offer (including a guarantee) can I make? 
- Is there an intriguing story I can tell?
- Who else is selling something similar to my product or service, and how?
- Who else has tried selling this target market something similar, and how has that effort failed? 
 
#### What does my target market want?
By analyzing what your target market is actually buying or looking for
- Look at products and categories that are trending on marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.
- Analyzing search engine queries using a tool like Google's AdWords Keyword Planner can be another excellent method.
- See what topics are trending on social media and industry news sites. What are people commenting on and reacting to?

#### Offers
- Language - You need to learn the language and jargon used within your target market.
- Reason why - When you have a great offer, you need to justify why you are doing this.
- Value stacking - Packing in many bonuses can make your offer seems like a no-brainer.
- Upsells
- Payment plan
- Guarantee
- Scarcity
- Target the pain
- Don't use monotone professional sales copy. People love to be entertained. Being yourself and bringing out
your personality will help you stand out in a sea of sameness and monotony.
- People buy from people, not from corporations.

### How to enter the mind of your prospect and join the conversation going on in there
- Before you ever write a single word of copy, you must intimately understand
  - how your target market thinks and talks
  - the kind of language they use and respond to
  - what kind of day they have and the conversation that goes on in their minds
  - their fears and frustrations
  - what gets them excited and motivated
- Tell potential prospects who your product or service is NOT for.
- Find out what they blame, and use a device in your copy known as "the enemy in common".

### How to effectively name your business, product, or service
If the name does not make it automatically obvious what the product, service or business is, then you're starting
from behind.

## Chapter 3: Reaching prospects with advertising media

### How to measure success of marketing campaign
By calculating ROI on the marketing campaign. If it cost you more than you made (or will ever make) on this campaign,
then it’s a failure. If it cost you less than the profits you made as result of the campaign, then it’s a success.
In some cases like subscription services, it is okay for ROI to go negative if you know that customers will come back
and keep paying in the future. 

### The lifetime value of a customer and how this is split up between the "front end" and "back end"
The money we make up front on a campaign is known as "the front end." The money we make on subsequent purchases is known
as "the back end." Together, these figures make up the lifetime value of a customer.

### The role that social media plays in your business
Social media, by definition, is a form of media - it's not a strategy.

### Pros
- It's a great place to create and extend relationships that can later turn into something commercial.
- It enables you to gauge customer emotions toward your business and engage with vocal customers who offer either praise
or complaints in a public form.

#### Cons
- It's not the ideal selling environment. same. Overt selling and constant pitching of offers are generally considered
poor behavior on social networks and can result in repelling people from your business rather than attracting them to it.
- It can be a time suck.
- Question of ownership. You don't actually own it.
 

### How to effectively use email and postal mail as part of your media strategy
#### Email
An email also enables you to maintain a close relationship with your customer base and makes it easy to test and launch
new products and services.
- Don't spam
- Be human
- Use a commercial email marketing system
- Email regularly
- Give them value
- Automate

#### Postal mail
It would be a mistake to underestimate the power of physical objects when it comes to moving people emotionally.
And, moving people emotionally towards a desired action is what marketing is all about.

Postal mail has a much longer lifespan and requires effort to dispose of. It’s not uncommon for people to treasure and
keep postal letters from significant people in their lives for decades.

Another important point about postal mail is that it has become significantly less cluttered over the past few years,
which from a marketer’s perspective is a dream come true.

### How to protect your business from "a single point of failure"
One is the most dangerous number in your business. It makes businesses brittle.
Identify and eliminate single points of failures in your business.

## Chapter 4: Capturing leads

### Why you should never try to sell directly from an advertisement and what to do instead
It’s true that some people reading your ad might be ready to buy immediately, but the vast majority will not be ready to
make a purchasing decision on the very day they read your ad, even if they are interested in what you do.

### How to transition from "hunting" to "farming" and ensure you always have a full pipeline of new business
In direct response marketing, the purpose of your advertising is to find people who are interested in what you do rather
than trying to make an immediate sale from the ad. When your interested leads respond, you put them in your follow-up
database so that you can build value for them, position yourself as an authority and create a relationship built on trust.

After doing this, the sale comes (if it’s right for them) as a natural consequence.

### Why you shouldn’t treat all prospects equally
Different people have different degree of interest into your product or service. You want to focus on those who are
really interested in your product or service.

### How to use an "ethical bribe" to uncover high-probability prospects
You promise to give them helpful resources like reports or videos on the topic that you think your target market is very
interested in in exchange for their contact information like email.

### How to instantly increase the effectiveness of your advertising by 1,233%
At any given time (on average) about 3% of your target market is highly motivated and ready to buy immediately.
These are the prospects most mass marketing hopes to convert. However, there’s a further 7% who are very open to buying
and another 30% who are interested but not right now. The next 30% are not interested and finally the last 30% would not
take your product, even if it were free.

By creating a lead-generating ad, you increase your addressable market to 40%. You do this by capturing the 3% who are
immediate buyers but also by capturing the 7% who are open to talking, as well as the 30% who are interested but not
right now.

By going from a 3% addressable market to 40%, you’re increasing the effectiveness of your advertising by 1,233%.

### Why some businesses get a constant flow of leads and prospects while others struggle
By building a marketing infrastructure. It will help you constantly brings in new leads, follows them up, nurtures and
converts them into raving fan customers.

At the absolute center of your marketing infrastructure is your database of customers and prospects, but to manage your
database effectively, you really need a customer relationship management (CRM) system. The CRM system is your marketing
nerve center. It’s where you manage your goldmine.

### How to be seen as an expert and authority by your target market
When you educate and teach, you are seen as an expert and an authority. You’re no longer questioned; instead you are
obeyed and seen to have a personal, genuine, helpful interest in other people.
