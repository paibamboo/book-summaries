## Chapter 1: Selecting you target market

### Why targeting everyone with your product or service is a terrible idea
Trying to target everyone really means that you’re targeting no one. By going too broad you kill your "specialness"
and become a commodity bought on price.

### Why mass marketing can be harmful to your business and cost you far more than it makes you
For mass marketing or branding to work, it is too expensive for small businesses. You need broadcast your message
regularly for a long period of time via multiple media channels so that people remember and recognize you.

### How to use the “PVP index” to select your perfect target market
A great way of figuring out your ideal target market is to use the PVP index by giving each market segment you serve a
rating out of 10.
- P - Personal Fulfilment
- V - Value to the marketplace
- P - Profitability

### Why you should focus on a niche and become a big fish in a small pond
- You have limited amount of money, if you focus too broadly, your marketing message will become weak and diluted.
- The other critical factor is relevance. The gold of your ad is for your prospect to say, "Hey that's for me!"

### How to make price irrelevant
By being a specialist, you are perceived differently by your prospects and customers. A specialist is sought after
rather than shopped on price. A specialist is much more highly respected than a jack-of-all-trades. A specialist is paid
handsomely to solve a specific problem for their target market.

### Why you should stop advertising a long list of products and services
If the ad just rolls out a broad laundry list of products or services, then it’s not speaking to any prospects,
therefore it’s not relevant, and it will likely be ignored by all market segments.
 
### How to go deep into the mind of your prospect so you can understand exactly what they want
One of the best tools for getting into the mind of your prospects is to temporarily become them by creating an avatar.
An avatar is a detailed exploration and description of your target customer and their life.
It's also important to create avatars for each type of decision maker or influencer you might encounter in your target
market.
